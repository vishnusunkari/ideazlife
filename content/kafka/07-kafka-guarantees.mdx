metaDescription: "Kafka Guarantees, Messages are appended to a topic-partition in the order 
they are sent. Consumers read messages in the order stored in a topic-partition"
---

- Messages are appended to a topic-partition in the order they are sent          
- Consumers read messages in the order stored in a topic-partition        
- With a replication factor of N, producers and consumers can tolerate upto 
N-1 brokers being down      
- This is why a replicaton factor of 3 is a good idea:     
  - Allows for one broker to be taken down for maintenance        
  - Allows for another broker to be taken down unexpectedly        
- As long as the number of partitions remains constant for a topic 
(no new partitions), the same key will always go to the same partition

### Producers

Producers can choose to receive acknowledgement of data writes:    
- acks=0: Producer won't wait for acknowledgement (possible data loss)     
- acks=1: Producer will wait for leader acknowledgement (limited data loss)    
- acks=all: Leader + replicas acknowledgement (no data loss)

### Producers: Message keys       

- Producers can choose to send a key with the message (string, number, etc..) 
- If key=null, data is sent round robin (broker 101 then 102 then 103..)
- If a key is sent, then all messages for that key will always go to the same partition
- A key is basically sent if you need message ordering for a specific field (ex: product_id)

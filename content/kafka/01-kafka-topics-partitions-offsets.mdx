### Topics, Partitions and Offsets    

```
            |  Partition 0  0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8  -----> writes    
Kafka Topic |  Partition 1  0|1|2|3| ------> writes    
            |  Partition 2  0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9 ------> writes    

``` 

- Offset only have a meaning for a specific partition.    
  - eg: offset 3 in partition 0 doesnot represent the same data as offset 3 in partition 1.    
- Order is guaranteed only within a partition (not across partitions)    
- Data is kept only for a limited time (default is one week)    
- Once the data is written to a partition, it can't be changed(immutability)    
- Data is assigned randomly to a partition unless a key is provided

### Brokers
- A Kafka cluster is composed of multiple brokers (servers)
- Each broker is identified with its ID (integer)
- Each broker contains certain topic partitions
- After connecting to any broker (called a bootstrap broker), you will be connected to the entire cluster
- A good number to get started is 3 brokers, but some big clusters have over 100 brokers.
- You can choose to number brokers starting at 100 (arbitrary)

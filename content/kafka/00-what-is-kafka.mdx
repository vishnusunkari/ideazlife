### What is Kafka ?  (For Realtime Data Feeds aka Event Streaming Platform)

Apache Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by the
Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide
a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.    


### 3 key capabilities of Kafka :    
1. To publish (write) and subscribe to (read) streams of events, including continuous import/export of your data from other systems.    
2. To store streams of events durably and reliably for as long as you want.    
3. To process streams of events as they occur or retrospectively.

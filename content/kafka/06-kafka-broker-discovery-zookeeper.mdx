### Kafka Broker Discovery    

- Every Kafka broker is called a bootstrap server.    
- That means that you only need to connect to one broker and you will be connected to the
entire cluster.    
- Each broker knows about all brokers, topics and partitions (metadata)

### Zookeeper     

- Zookeeper manages brokers (keeps a list of them)    
- Zookeeper helps in performing leader election for partitions    
- Zookeeper sends notifications to Kafka in case of changes (eg new topic,
 broker dies, broker comes up, delete topics etc)    
- **Kakfa can't work without Zookeeper**     
- Zookeeper by design operates with an odd number of servers(3, 5, 7)      
- Zookeeper has a leader (handle writes) the rest of the servers are followers (handle reads)     
- Zookeeper does NOT store consumer offsets with Kafka > v0.10)

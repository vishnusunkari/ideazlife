### CloudFormation (Infrastructure as a Service) 

JSON or YAML  
Base entity : Stacks tied with resources for creation, update, deletion  
Required: Resource definition  

### Template Portability and Reuse 
- Parameters with default values or no parameters at all
- Pull the values from System Manager Parameter Store
- Pseudo Parameters (eg:  AWS::Region, Partition, StackId, StackName, URLSuffix etc) 
- Intrinsic Functions (eg: Fn::GetAZs, Fn::ImportValue, Ref etc)

### Cross stack references    
- Base Infrastructure values like VPCId, subnets, can be referenced in other stacks  
- Using Ref, Export, Fn::ImportValue  
- Reuse Stacks  

### Nested Stacks  
- Reuse blocks of CloudFormation templates.  
- Reuse same template code but create multiple different stacks with the same template.  
- Share outputs with parameters between these stacks using nested stacks.  
eg: GetAtt 'VPCStack.Outputs.VPCID'

### Stack Roles 
- Allows anyone to use CloudFormation provision,update delete based on the roles permissions.
- Allows separate security rules.
- Its IAM Role -> AWS Service -> CloudFormation Role 

### Stack Sets  
- Administrator Account and a Target Account
- Allow you to deploy a cloudformation template into multiple regions or 
- Multiple regions in multiple accounts at the same time.
- You need to establish a trust between these accounts by creating 2 roles:
- AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdminRole in Admin Account and 
- AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole in Target Account.
eg: Enable cloudtrail across multiple accounts, enable mfa accross multiple accounts etc.

### Custom Resources 
- Custom Resource in CloudFormation Template.
- Used in scenarios when you want to build Hybrid Infrastructure (Both AWS and Outside AWS)
(eg: Retrieve a license key to activate)
- CloudFormation Sends a notification event to a lambda or SNS topic
- Define   
  - Custom::AMIInfo
  - ServiceToken : { } is the endpoint of lambda or SNS topic
- Receives Response on a pre-signed S3 URL   

CloudFormer tool is used to create CloudFormation template files from existing stack.  
CloudFormation can be used as one of the Disaster Recovery Strategies.

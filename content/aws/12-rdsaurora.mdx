### RDS vs Aurora   

| RDS                                                                  | Aurora                                                                                                                                                 |

| Master and Slave have their own separate underlying hardware storage | Master and Slave share same underlying hardware storage cluster across a region.                                                                       |

| Oracle RAC is not supported by RDS.                                  | Allows incremental backups up to 35 days.                                                                                                              |

Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters) is not supported by RDS. ie why you need to deploy the database in an EC2 instance.
								   
### Aurora Serverless        
Concept of Warm pool of instances (without any data) ready to swap into an existing serverless cluster as capacity is needed.   
Connections are managed by a shared proxy layer which brokers connections and stops interruptions due to scaling events or failures.   

ACU : 1 Aurora Capacity Unit (2GB + 1vCPU)   

- If an AZ fails, switching to a new AZ takes time with increased failover time.    
- Supports Query Editor using Data API.   
- You can connect to DB in both ways as mysql connection as well as via AWS API.

### Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)

### Application 
At the Base level is Application.  Container of environments, versions, environment configs.   
### Environment
An environment of a given tier(web server / worker batch jobs).
### Application Version
Distinct Version of application, eg: ApplicationName-V1.jar).    
- In the background it uses CloudFormation.  
- Supports Blue-Green Deployments natively.  
- Recommended to deploy databases outside of Beanstalk as the data can be deleted when the environment is removed.  
- eb-extensions folder inside Application Versions to allow config info to connect to SQS or other etc.  

AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides several options for how deployments are processed, including deployment 
 policies (All at once, Rolling, Rolling with additional batch, and Immutable) and options that let you 
 configure batch size and health check behavior during deployments.    
By default, your environment uses :
 1. Rolling deployments if you created it with the console or EB CLI, or 
 2. All-at-once deployments if you created it with a different client (API, SDK, or AWS CLI).   

Beanstalk takes care :
- Provisioning
- Capacity Provisioning
- Autoscaling
- Load-balancing
- Application Health Monitoring.     

To alter application settings and software configurations that run on the EC2 instances 
created by Elastic Beanstalk, configuration files can be added to a specifically named 
folder in the application code versions, which are applied during the deployment process.   
 
To use configuration files, a folder named .ebextensions is created at the top level of 
the project's source code. Then files with the extension .config are added to specify options.   

Configuration Presets:
1. Low cost, 
2. HA, 
3. Custom configuration

### Elastic Beanstalk Creation of RDS DB Instances    
Elastic Beanstalk takes care of creating the RDS databased instances automatically, 
but since the database hostname is not known until this environment is created, this 
may leave you asking, "How will the application know "what to use to connect to the database?"    
Elastic Beanstalk takes care of this by providing access to such information through 
environment properties. For RDS, it exposes all of the necessary connection parameter 
information to the application as environment properties. These properties are passed 
in the application when the Elastic Beanstalk creates the environment. 
So, the database hostname, DB name, the port, the username, and password can all be 
accessed through environment variables.   

### Rolling Deployments   
With rolling deployments, Elastic Beanstalk splits the environment's EC2 instances into batches and deploys
 the new version of the application to one batch at a time, leaving the rest of the instances in the 
 environment running the old version of the application. During a rolling deployment, some instances serve 
 requests with the old version of the application, while instances in completed batches serve other requests 
 with the new version.

### S3 (Storage Bucket)

What is S3?   
S3 stands for Simple Storage Service.  It provides secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage.  It means safe place to store your files. 
It is object-based storage.  Files are stored in buckets (folders). Bucket names must be globally unique. 

### Permissions
- IAM permissions 
- Bucket policy on bucket
- ACL(Access Control Lists) on objects
- Public Access Settings at Account Level and Bucket Level
- Pre-Signed URLs 

### Versioning 
Versioning is required for Cross-region replication.  
Versioning delete marker.

### Object Locking 
- Retention Periods : prevent updates or deletes for a given period of time.    
- Legal Holds : prevent updates or deletes until the Legal Hold is removed.   
- Versioning is required and through UI only during the bucket creation. Later by support ticket.   
- Cross-region replication is not supported with Object Locking enabled.   
- Cross-region replication is not supported when custom managed encryption is enabled on buckets.

### S3 Encryption 
Encryption can be applied both on buckets as default and at object level which overides the default.

S3 encryption types :
- None
- SSE-S3 (AES-256)
- SSE-KMS
- SSE-C (Customer Key)

### S3 Performance

1. Multipart Upload
2. Transfer Acceleration
3. Partitions and Object Naming. eg: bucket names should not start with current date or same name.

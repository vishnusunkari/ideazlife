### EFS (File System)    

EFS stands for Elastic File System.  Similar to NFS mount file systems.   
Highly scalable, highly performant shared File system.
Uses NFS protocol. Inside VPC. 
Create mount targets in each AZ (Availability Zone) inside a subnet for high availability.
Each mount targets are secured by SG (Security Group). 

Supports encryption at rest as well as encryption in transit(which is configured at the client during mount target creation). 
Need to enable encryption during creation and give KMS master key.

amazon-efs-utils to interact with this file system. 

To mount storage into the current filesystem: Either EBS or EFS   
EBS allows mounting storage in the same AZ   
EFS has no restriction of AZ.   

AWS Backup to backup EFS using Storage Gateway. With just a few clicks in the AWS Backup console, 
you can create backup policies that automate backup schedules and retention management. 
AWS Backup provides a fully managed, policy-based backup solution.
You can backup AWS resources duch as EBS, RDS, DynamoDB tables, EFS & Storage Gateway volumes.


AWS Datasync to synchronize/migrate filesystem into EFS from other file systems like on-premise filesystem.
The DataSync software agent connects to your Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB) storage,
so you donâ€™t have to modify your applications. DataSync can transfer hundreds of terabytes and millions of 
files at speeds up to 10 times faster than open-source tools, over the internet or AWS Direct Connect links. 

Performance mode: (can be set only during EFS creation)   
- General Purpose (99% of the times)
- MaxI/O (higher throughput, parallel mode but additional latency)

Throughput mode: (can set even after creation)   
- Bursting  (99% of the times)
- Provisioned   

EFS is capable of throughput of 10+gb/sec and 1000s of connections.

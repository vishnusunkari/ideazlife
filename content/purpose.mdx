# Purpose

#### What is Purpose?
Purpose refers to the reason or motivation behind a particular action, goal, or existence. It is the driving force 
that gives direction and meaning to our lives. Purpose can come from many sources, such as personal values, 
beliefs, relationships, or a sense of mission or calling. When we have a clear sense of purpose, we are more likely 
to feel fulfilled, motivated, and engaged in our lives. It can also help us make difficult decisions, persevere 
through challenges, and find a sense of connection and belonging in the world.
